# Task: ATM machine

## Introduction
Let's imagine you start working as backend engineer in the bank called "BANK". 
Your manager assigns you to project to develop ATM managing service. 
Interviewer is your team-mate, who is already working on the project for quite a while. 
He knows well business part of the work and can advise you on technical solutions. 
Therefore, feel free to communicate with him and ask for help.

## Description
Business wants card balance display feature.
ATM managing service has already all integration with hardware components and bank remote-service. 
So, you need to implement only business logic of showing card balance, with following criteria:
* User cannot see balance without verifying access (PIN validation);
* User cannot see balance if card blocked;
* If PIN wrong, user should know how many attempts are left;

## Tech requirements
* Kotlin/Java language;
* Cover your code with unit tests;
* Consider if some components or parts of the system can go wrong;
* Think about which part of the code could be reusable in further development;
